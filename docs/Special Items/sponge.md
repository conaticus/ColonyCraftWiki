# Sponge

A sponge can be crafted by those with [Mining](/docs/skills/mining.md) Level 3 [(See Recipe Here)](/docs/recipes/sponge.md).

We have modified sponges so that they absorb lava, this can help you to find ores and navigate caves:

Once a sponge has absorbed lava/water, it becomes wet. To dry it, either smelt it in a furnace or let it dry in the sun:
