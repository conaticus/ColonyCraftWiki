# Raids

In Colony Craft you can raid other people's bases and steal the items kept inside them. In order to raid other people's bases, you first need a Raid Pickaxe (see [Raid Pickaxe Recipes](/docs/recipes/raid-pickaxes.md)). Fortunately, there are no skill requirements to obtain the ores or recipes for Raid Pickaxes.

### Raiding a Base
All containers in bases can be opened by any player, no matter if land is claimed or not (see [Protecting your Items](/docs/claims/protecting_items.md#protecting-your-items)). Once you find a container, such as a chest, you can open it and steal the items inside it!

In order to break into a claimed base and gain access to items, you must use a Raid Pickaxe to destroy the blocks inside it. To do this, you must:
1. Equip your Raid Pickaxe
2. Look at the block you want to destroy
3. Spam click (**do not hold**) the block, and wait for the progress bar to complete

Example:

### Pickaxe Rates
Well protected bases will use protection blocks to protect their items. These will be harder to destroy than regular blocks. Bare in mind that iron doors/iron trap doors cannot be destroyed with a raid pickaxe. Refer to this table to see the rates for different blocks:
