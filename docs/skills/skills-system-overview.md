# Skills System Overview

### Skill Focus

In Colony Craft, you can develop your own skills to be a unique asset to other players in the server. You can only focus on one skill at a time. A skill can be completed by reaching Level 5, and you can then select a new skill to focus on.

:::note note
If you are killed by another player you will lose **1 level** from your focused skill (if you have a focused skill).
:::

To select a skill, use the `/skill_focus` command, and you will be presented with a menu to choose your skill focus:

<img src="/img/skillfocus.png" width="30%" />

<br />
<br />

You can hover over these to see their different perks, or alternatively use the `/skill_perks [skill]` command.

You can click one to make it your Skill Focus! If you wish to change your skill focus, you can use the `/skill_focus` command again, but any progress will be lost.
