# Farming

The farming skill can be progressed by harvesting crops. Food is a scarce resource in Colony Craft and farmers are a very useful asset to all players in the server.

Crops can be farmed on your own land or found randomly across the map:

### Creating a Farm

Seeds can only be planted on claimed land, follow our [Claiming Land](/docs/claims/claims.md) tutorial to find out how to claim land. Once these have been planted, and your crops have grown, you can harvest them for XP.

**Growth Rates** \
Crops that are placed inside a claim grow 2x slower than usual rates in Minecraft. This is increased to the usual rate when reaching Level 3. When you are offline, crops grow 4x slower, no matter what level the player is.

### Bees

:::warning Disclaimer
Our map does not spawn Bees nests naturally, you must get these to spawn yourself using Oak, Birch or Cherry Saplings.
:::

Bees can be used to accelerate crop growth on your farm. You first need a bees nest to spawn nearby your claim. The [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Bee_Nest#Post-generation) addresses how to spawn bees nests post world generation:

> _Oak, birch, or cherry trees grown from saplings that are within 2 blocks (including diagonally) of a flower on the same Y-level have a 5% chance to grow with a bee nest containing 2â€“3 bees. This holds true in any biome in any dimension, and for any flower including wither roses and flowering azaleas._

Bees carrying pollen can be used to accelerate the growth of your crops:

<div style={{ display: "flex" }}>
    <div>
        <img src="/img/bee.webp" width="250" />
        Bee without necter.
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="/img/bee_nectar.webp" width="250" />
        Bee with necter.
    </div>

</div>

If a bee with necter is lured (using a flower), or flies over your crops, it has a chance of pollenating them, if this happens you will gain XP and your crop's growth will be accelerated:

<br />

At Level 3 you can also harvest honey from bees nests which can be an excellent food source for players. At Level 4 you can craft bee hives to place directly in front of your farms (to pollenate crops faster).

### Bonemeal

At level 1 you are able to craft bonemeal. This can be used to accelerate the growth of your crops. Bones are required to craft bonemeal, however, which can only be obtained by players with the Combat Skill [(Learn More)](/docs/skills/combat.md#bones).

### Levels

Level 1: 20 Crops Per Claim, Can Use Bonemeal

Level 2: 40 Crops Per Claim, Can Cook Food

Level 3: Can Harvest Honey, Crops Grow 2x Faster

Level 4: 60 Crops Per Claim, Can Craft Bee Hive ([Vanilla Recipe](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Beehive#Crafting))

Level 5: 100 Crops per Claim

### XP Table

|       Crop        | XP Amount |
| :---------------: | :-------: |
|  Melon, Pumpkin   |    400    |
| Carrots, Potatoes |    200    |
