# Farming

:::note Disclaimer
Our skills system is quickly evolving, this article may become outdated. You can check skill perks in game by running: \

The farming skill can be progressed by harvesting crops. Food is a scarce resource in Colony Craft and farmers are a very useful asset to all players in the server.

Crops can be farmed on your own land or found randomly across the map:

### Creating a Farm

Seeds can only be planted on claimed land, follow our [Creating Claims](/docs/claims/claims.md) tutorial to find out how to claim land. Once these have been planted, and your crops have grown, you can harvest them for XP

### Bees

:::warning Disclaimer
Our map does not spawn Bees nests naturally, you must get these to spawn yourself using Oak, Birch or Cherry Saplings.
:::

Bees can be used to accelerate crop growth on your farm. You first need a bees nest to spawn nearby your claim. The [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Bee_Nest#Post-generation) addresses how to spawn bees nests post world generation:

> _Oak, birch, or cherry trees grown from saplings that are within 2 blocks (including diagonally) of a flower on the same Y-level have a 5% chance to grow with a bee nest containing 2â€“3 bees. This holds true in any biome in any dimension, and for any flower including wither roses and flowering azaleas._

If a bee is lured (using a flower), or flies over your crops, it has a chance of fertilizing them, if this happens you will gain XP and your crop's growth will be accelerated:

### Bonemeal
