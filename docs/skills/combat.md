The combat skill can be progressed by killing mobs in the game. You unlock various Netherite tools as your progress (see [Netherite Recipes](/docs/recipes/netherite-tools-armour.md))

### Levels

Level 1: Can Craft & Use Diamond Sword

Level 2: Can Craft & Use Diamond Axe, Bow & Crossbow

Level 3: Can Craft & Use Netherite Sword

### Bones

Bones are an item that can **only** be obtained by players with the Combat skill (starting from Level 0). These can be dropped by Skeletons. This is beneficial for farmers who might want to craft this into bonemeal.

If you kill a skeleton with a bow, there is a 2x higher chance that a skeleton will drop bones.

### XP Bonuses

If you kill a mob with any Axe or Bow, you will get an XP bonus.

Axe: 1.5x Bonus \
Bow: 2.5x Bonus
