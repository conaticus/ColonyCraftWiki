# Combat

The combat skill can be progressed by killing mobs in the game. You unlock various Netherite tools as your progress (see [Netherite Recipes](/docs/recipes/netherite-tools-armour.md))

### Bones

Bones are an item that can **only** be obtained by players with the Combat skill (starting from Level 0). These can be dropped by Skeletons. This is beneficial for farmers who might want to craft this into bonemeal.

### XP Bonuses

If you kill a mob with any Axe or Bow, you will get an XP bonus.

Axe: 1.5x Bonus \
Bow: 2.5x Bonus
