:::note disclaimer
Our skills system is quickly evolving, this article may become outdated. you can check skill perks in game by running: \
`/skill_perks <skill type>`. you can also check the `#changelog` in our discord server [(click here)](https://discord.gg/zcwwhgqyjn).
:::

The mobility skill is progressed by moving long distances & carrying valuables.

### Gaining XP
:::note Note
Walking around in circles will not gain you XP, you have to actively move long distances for XP to be counted.
:::

Most of your XP for this skill can be gained by carrying valuables in your inventory over long distances. Every 300 blocks moved from your previous location will give you 300XP and a bonus for how many valuables you are carrying, including any items inside shulker boxes. You can only get a maximum XP bonus of 2,000XP.

You can refer to the [XP Table](#xp-table) below to find the XP gained for each valuable.

Note that carrying valuable blocks such as diamond blocks will count the valuable amount 9 times, and raw ores are also counted (such as iron ore).

For example, if a player is carrying:

- 2 Iron Ore
- 20 Redstone
- 3 Emerald Blocks

Then:

2 Iron Ore       × 2 XP      =   4 XP  
20 Redstone      × 2 XP      =  40 XP  
3 Emerald Blocks × 9 × 10 XP = 270 XP  

Total Bonus XP: 4 + 40 + 270 = 314 XP  
Blocks Covered: 300 XP  
Final Total:    300 + 314 = **614 XP**

### `/speed` command
At Level 3, you gain access to the `/speed` command. This can be toggled (run again to turn it off) to give you Speed 1. If you enter combat with another player, the speed effect will be removed and you will be on a 5 minutes cooldown before you can use this command again.
