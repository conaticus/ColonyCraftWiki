# What is Colony Craft?

Colony Craft is a Minecraft Server that is based on the many Minecraft Civilization style videos that have been surging recently. These were received incredibly well by players and we wanted to bring this to life in a 24/7 free and accessible server!

You can team up with players, develop specialised skills, and raid other people's bases using our exciting raids mechanic! This is designed to bring a balanced and exciting twist to Minecraft Survival adding mechanics that make it function as its own economy.

Here is an example of what inspired us to create this server: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv-TS_mEHE4

## Rules

1. No XP Farming (do not create automated systems to get skill XP quickly, skills must be progressed legitimately)
2. No spawn killing
3. No cheating/hacking of any kind
4. No toxic behaviour/insulting other players
5. No bricking (using unbreakable blocks as a replacement to protection blocks)
6. No combat logging
