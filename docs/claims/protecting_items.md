# Protecting your Items

Even if your land is protected with our claims system, it can still be raided by other players (see [Raids](/docs/raids.md) to learn how).

Even if placed in your claim, unprotected containers can be opened by any player:

It's important that these containers are not left out in the open, and are ideally coated with [protection blocks](#using-protection-blocks).

Here is a list of containers that can be opened by anyone:

- Chest
- Trapped Chest
- Barrel
- Dispenser
- Dropper
- Hopper
- Furnace
- Blast Furnace
- Smoker
- Brewing Stand
- Shulker Box
- Armour Stand
- Item Frame

### Using Protection Blocks

Protection blocks are special blocks that can make it difficult for raiders to access your items. There are three tiers:

- Weak Protection Block
- Medium Protection Block
- Strong Protection Block

See the [Protection Block Recipes](/docs/recipes/protection-blocks.md) to learn how to craft these. All players can mine Limonite Ore (see [Ores & Locations](/docs/ore-spawns.md)) which can be used to make the Weak Protection Block. The rest require ores that can only be mined by players with the Mining Skill (see [Mining Levels](/docs/skills/mining.md#levels)).

:::info Tips

- Ensure you fill all ways that the container could be reached (cover the bottom, sides and top of the container)
- Make protection blocks hidden so raiders cannot see what raid pickaxe they need
- Avoid filling redundant corners and use iron trapdoors to minimise protection blocks used
- **DO NOT** use wooden doors/trapdoors, these can easily be broken by raiders
  :::

Once you have crafted enough protection blocks, you can protect chests using these as well as an iron door or iron trap door, ensure you place a button or lever so that you can open the door. Here is an example of a chest covered with a the weak protection block:

Note that iron doors & iron trap doors cannot be destroyed by raiders.
