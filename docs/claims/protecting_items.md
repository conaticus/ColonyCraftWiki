# Protecting your Items

Even if your land is protected with our claims system, it can still be raided by other players (see [Raids](/docs/raids.md) to learn how).

Even if placed in your claim, containers can be opened by any player who has access to them:

It's important that these containers are not left out in the open, and are ideally coated with [protection blocks](#using-protection-blocks).

Here is a list of containers that can be opened by anyone:
- Chest
- Trapped Chest
- Barrel
- Dispenser
- Dropper
- Hopper
- Furnace
- Blast Furnace
- Smoker
- Brewing Stand
- Shulker Box
- Armour Stand
- Item Frame

### Using Protection Blocks
Protection blocks are special blocks that can make it difficult for raiders to access your items. There are three tiers:
- Weak Protection Block
- Medium Protection Block
- Strong Protection Block

See the [Protection Block Recipes](/docs/recipes/protection-blocks.md) to learn how to craft these. The only protection block immediately available to all players is the Weak Protection Block. The rest require ores that can only be mined by players with the Mining Skill (see [Mining Levels](/docs/skills/mining.md#levels)).

Once you have crafted enough protection blocks, you can protect chests using these as well as an iron door or iron trap door, ensure you place a button or lever so that you can open the door. Here is an example of a chest covered with a the weak protection block:

Iron doors & iron trap doors cannot be destroyed by raiders.
