# Claim Whitelists

Whitelisting players to your land will give them access to do anything on your land. Whitelisted players will not be able to manage whitelists on your claim or do operations such as editing the dimensions/deleting it.

#### Whitelist Player

Whitelist a specific player to your plot by running `/whitelist_player <playername>`

#### Whitelist Colony

:::info
This will not work if you are not in a colony, see our **[Colonies Guide](/docs/colonies/colonies.md)** to learn more.

If you leave your colony, colony members will not longer have access to your claim (except for players whitelisted with `/whitelist_player` )
:::

Whitelist all players in your colony with `/whitelist_colony`

#### List Whitelists

List all whitelists to your plot with `/whitelists`

#### Blacklist Player

Blacklist a whitelisted player with `/blacklist_player <playername>`

#### Blacklist Colony

Blacklist all members in your colony who were not whitelisted with `/whitelist_player`.

#### Blacklist All

Blacklist all players & colonies whitelisted to your plot with `/blacklist_all`
