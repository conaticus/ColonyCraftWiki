# Colonies

:::warning Important
If a colony leader is killed by another player, the colony will be destroyed and all members will be removed. All members in the server will be notified if this happens.
:::

A Colony is effectively a team of players in the server. Members in the same Colony cannot PVP with each other. Colonies can have an infinite number of members and require Engineer Level 2 to be created - [See About Engineers](/docs/skills/engineer.md).

Colonies are intended for players to be able to team up and rival against each other or build [alliances](/docs/colonies/alliances.md).

Once you are in a colony, the name will display next to your username:

Colony leaders are attributed the "LEADER" tag:
