# Join a Colony

### Public Colonies

If a colony is public, and you are not banished, you can join it by running `/colony_join <colony name>`

### Invite Only Colonies

Some colonies are marked by leaders as "invite only". In order to join these colonies, you must be invited by the colony leader and accept their invite with `/accept invite`.

### Leaving a Colony

:::warning
If you leave a colony, you will not be able to join back without being re-invited by the colony leader, even if the colony is public.
:::

You can leave a colony by using the `/colony_leave` command.
