# Alliances

If two colonies are in an alliance, combat will be disabled between all players in both colonies. This is intended for colonies who have peace/trade agreements.

## List Alliances

You can list all of the alliances your colony is in by running the `/alliances` command.

## Request an Alliance

As a colony leader, you can request to start an alliance with another colony by:

- Standing within 10 blocks of the colony leader
- Running `/alliance_request <colony name>`

If the leader accepts your request, you will be in an alliance with the other colony, and all members of each colony will be notified.

## Leaving an Alliance

A colony leader can opt out of an alliance at any time by running the `/alliance_leave` command. If this happens, all members of each colony will be notified that the alliance has ended.
