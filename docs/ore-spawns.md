# Ores & Locations

### Obtaining Ores

It's important to check what skills you need (if any) to mine the ore you are looking for. You can check if an ore is possible for you to mine by checking `/skill_perks Mining`.

### Ore Y Levels

These ores may spawn at higher levels if you are in an [ore hotspot](#ore-hotspots).

- Limonite Ore: `-64` - `62`
- Acanthite Ore: `-64` - `0`
- Valtronium Ore: `-64` - `-30`
- Netherite: `-64` - `-30`

The rest of the ores that occur spawn at vanilla Minecraft Y Levels (check Minecraft Wiki).

### Ore Hotspots

All ores in Colony Craft spawn across the whole map, however there are specific spots on the map where they may spawn more commonly. Here is a map to demonstrate the hotspot locations in the world:
